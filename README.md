## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository showcases my work as a web developer specializing in building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly static websites using Gatsby and GraphQL. With a strong focus on modern web performance and best practices, this project serves as both a portfolio and a practical implementation of advanced front-end development techniques.

At the core of this project is Gatsby, a powerful static site generator built on React. By leveraging GraphQL for data fetching, I can efficiently source and query data from various APIs, CMSs (like Contentful or Sanity), Markdown files, and local imagesâ€”all at build time. This ensures that each page is pre-rendered with only the necessary data, eliminating unnecessary client-side requests and reducing overall page load times.

One of the key goals of this project is performance optimization. I employ techniques such as image lazy-loading, responsive image generation using gatsby-plugin-image, code splitting, and critical CSS extraction. Lighthouse scores are continuously monitored and optimized to meet modern web standards for speed and accessibility.

SEO is another major pillar of this repository. Gatsbyâ€™s support for dynamic metadata, structured data, and sitemap generation ensures excellent discoverability by search engines. Tools like react-helmet, canonical URLs, and optimized Open Graph tags contribute to rich social previews and improved indexing.

Whether you're here to explore effective data fetching strategies, learn how to fine-tune a static site for SEO, or see practical examples of performance-first web development, this repository aims to deliver. Feel free to fork, clone, or raise an issueâ€”contributions and feedback are always welcome!
